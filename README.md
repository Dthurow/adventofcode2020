# adventofcode2020

Repo for tracking my code while working through https://adventofcode.com/2020. Not trying to keep up with each day, will stop when I have to like, implement my own parser, most likely.

Each day's code is in day[daynum]_pt[].rb. First problem is pt1, second problem is pt2. The input is day[daynum]_input.txt. output.txt is where I feed the output of my code periodically if I want to do some text searching/processing on the output.
